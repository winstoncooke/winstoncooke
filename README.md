I am a full stack developer that primarily works with JavaScript (React, Node, Express), Java, and Kotlin. I focus on contributing to open-source projects that I find make a genuine impact for everyone.

My current focus is learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

I've contributed to the following open source projects:
- [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)
- [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit)

My hobbies include sim racing, tennis, Formula 1, and the Premier League.
