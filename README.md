I am a backend developer that primarily works with Java and Kotlin. I focus on contributing to open-source projects that I find make a genuine impact for everyone.

I've contributed to the following open source projects:
- [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)
- [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit)

My hobbies include sim racing, tennis, Formula 1, and the Premier League.
