I am a backend developer that primarily codes in Java. My work focuses on contributing to open-source projects that I find useful.

My current focus is:
- [AccountingSoftware](https://github.com/winstoncooke/AccountingSoftware), an open-source offline bookkeeping app

I've also contributed to the following open source projects:
- [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit)

My hobbies include sim racing, tennis, and premier league.
