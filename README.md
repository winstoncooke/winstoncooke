I am a full stack developer that primarily works with JavaScript (Mongo, Express, React, Node), TypeScript, Java, and Kotlin. I focus on contributing to open-source projects that I find make a genuine impact for everyone. I am fascinated by emulation projects and support historic preservation.

My current focus is learning [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber) to build 3D websites.

I've contributed to the following open source projects:
- [Anki-Android](https://github.com/ankidroid/Anki-Android)
- [Infinity for Reddit](https://github.com/Docile-Alligator/Infinity-For-Reddit)

My hobbies include sim racing, tennis, and bicycling.
